"""Measure the placement questions this machine can settle, and report them.

Some placement choices are gated to one platform because the measurement
behind them is from one platform. The engine cannot guess the others: on
Windows PyTorch has no expandable segments, so the same allocations can need
more *reserved* memory, and the desktop compositor takes VRAM while a request
runs. So the gates stay closed until a machine of that kind reports back.

This runs the pair that would open a gate. It plans for the live card with no
simulated cap, keeps everything identical except the named fields, and records
what each variant reserved and how long its steps took. Nothing is decided
here; the report is the evidence for deciding.

Only questions that apply to this machine's own plan run, so a machine whose
plan has no open question does nothing and says so.
